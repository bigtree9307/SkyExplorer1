            <h2 class="SectionTitle">Sample Scenarios</h2>
            <p>Here are some common scenarios of this application. We demonstrate its functions and features by answering some questions related to air transportation.</p>

            <h4>How many destinations does Port Columbus International Airport (CMH) have? And where are they?</h4>
            <p>
                Just click an airport, you will see the routes shown in the map. You might be surprised to find Port Columbus <i>International</i> Airport
                has international destinations indeed! By selecting the airport from the dropdown box or picking up the destination in the map, you will
                see the detail information of each route.
            </p>

            <div class="DivBorder">
                <img src="png/skyexplorer_t100_info/faq1.png" style="padding: 5px;" /><br />
                <div style="padding: 10px;">
                    <b>Image 1</b>: Destinations from CMH in 2012.
                </div>
            </div>

            <h4>What are the popular international destinations of San Francisco International Airport (SFO) in 2013?</h4>
            <p>
                Select SFO from the map, or input SFO in the "Airport" text box then click "Search". You will see SFO shown as an origin airport with many connections in the map.
                You could launch a detail page by clicking (Airport Detail Report) in the right of airport code. You may filter the detail report by region. In the rank of international
                destinations, London is the top international passenger destination.
            </p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <h4>Which airport is suffering a decline in passenger flow?</h4>
            <p>
                User can find the time series chart in airport detail report page. Maybe Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport is a good example for decline. From 2005, the passenger
                flow has been descending year by year significantly. One major reason is that Delta is abandoning this hub after merging with Northwest.
            </p>
            <div class="DivBorder">
                <img src="png/skyexplorer_t100_info/faq4.png" style="padding: 5px;" /><br />

            </div>

            <h4>Which aircraft was used to operated the flight between Washington DC and Moscow in 1990, 2000 and 2013?</h4>
            <p>
                There is a detail page for each route too. You could click an origin (IAD/Washington Dulles International Airport) and then select the
                destination (SVO/Sheremetyevo International Airport) to see the route.
                Clicking the (Route Detail Report) link at the bottom in the left will launch the route detail report.
                We can find that this route is operated by USSR's airline: Aeroflot. The aircraft changed for several times, from Ilyushin 62, an old-style Russian aircraft,
                to Boeing 767-300, a US-made aircraft.

            <h4>How about the load factor for the route between Los Angeles and London?</h4>
            <p>
                Select the route in the map and launch the route detail report UI. In the "Time series of seat" tab you could find some charts about available seats and
                load factor of different airlines. Generally speaking British Airway has best performance in load factor, which is higher than 80% in most of the months.
                American Airlines is the second and United Airlines is the third, with a load factor around 60% to 80%. Virgin Atlantic only provides seasonal service in the
                summer.

            </div>

            <h4>What's the main freight hub of FedEx outside US?</h4>
            <p>
                This app provides an "Airline View" for those who is interested in the shape of airline's network. We have full data for US carriers between 2003 and 2009. User can switch to
                "Airline view" by clicking the button in the title bar, and then select an airline to view its network. User could specify which year to show, and filter the routes by region.
                Only the top 400 routes in terms of flow will be shown. From the map we can observer that Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport was FedEx's most important airport in Europe. In Asia,
                there are several important airports: Guangzhou (CAN), Narita (NRT) and Hong Kong (HKG). Some of the routes are single-directed. However, due to the limitation of visualization,
                you could not determine whether it from the map directly.

            <h4>How to change data sources?</h4>
            <p>
                In the airport view, the data source panel in top-right allows you to select/unselect a data source. If you are only interested in the T100 data source, you might uncheck all
                other data sources.
                Sometimes there will be data from multiple sources for the same route. In this case, user could switch to another available data source in <i>View data from other sources in this route</i> label
                in the destination panel.
                <i>View data from other sources in this route</i> is also available in route detail report dialog, if there are multiple sources for the given route.
            </p>

            <h2 class="SectionTitle">FAQ</h2>
            <h4>For the same route. why there are obvious differences in statistics between two data sources?</h4>
            <p>
                There are several reasons. First, the data collection step in local airport caueses difference. 
                Second, different data sources apply vairous standards. For example, a regular flight in source A might be classified as charter/casual flight in source B.
                Third, some definitions are also very vague. For example, <i>cargo</i> might include both freight and mail, or even the luggage of passengers. Sometimes the data source 
                doesn't give a clear explaination on this value.
            </p>

            <h4>When I click an important airport, why it only shows partial routes? Some routes are missed.</h4>
            <p>
                In the system, we only shows the routes from the available data sources. For the airport not fully covered by these data sources, only the available route are shown. 
                For example, for Dubai International Airport, we could only show destinations toward US, UK, Japan, South Korean, Taiwan at this moment.
                We understand that showing partial data is confusing. However, without the full aviation network connection data, this is the compromised way to present the data.
                One solution is to utilize the Wikipedia page by showing the destinations from airport information page. However, the accuracy of Wikipedia data is far from our criteria.
                Therefore, currently we are doing experiement that only show the Wikipedia data in a few airports.
