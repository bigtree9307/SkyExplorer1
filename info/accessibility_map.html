			<h2 class="SectionTitle">INTRODUCTION</h2>
			<p>
				This project provides an overview of current US domestic air passenger traffic. It shows the
				results in detailed maps of the air service accessibility of individual airports (places). The
				wide range and geographical scope (400+ airports) of the data assure coverage of both large
				national hubs, as well as many smaller airports in every region. The idea is to use non-stop
				service as an <b>ACCESSIBILITY INDEX</b> to develop contrasts between levels of service (e.g.
				non-stop vs. one- and two-stop service). Such an index provides a simple summary measure of the
				<i>geographical contrasts</i> between places in the current domestic air passenger transport
				system.
			</p>
			<p>
				The project will illustrate changes in these results <u>over time</u> and so will produce
				measures of the changes in air accessibility. It is expected that many interesting features of
				the system will emerge. By providing a comprehensive panorama for all parts of the US, an
				unusually rich data portrait is given. Each region has individual maps for the airports in that
				State or Territory. Each map contains information about that particular origin airport's
				results.
			</p>

			<h2 class="SectionTitle">THE INDEX OF MAPS</h2>
			<p>Here is the list of maps of the data. The atlas is organized by states/regions. You can
				select any of them to investigate the detailed information of each quarter. Currently, we have
				made 4 quarters in 2011 available, and will update with 2012 as it becomes available.</p>

			<h2 class="SectionTitle">DATA</h2>
			<p>A key ingredient in these maps is the actual travel patterns observed from the
				DB1B(Airline Origin and Destination Survey),which is a 10% sample of air tickets for each
				quarter. Its data includes origin, destination and other itinerary details of passengers
				transported. The most important information is how many stops are involved on each itinerary. We
				recover the accessibility indicator from this 0/1/2 stops information. Our first release
				contains the 2011 results.</p>


			<h2 class="SectionTitle">QUESTION</h2>
			<p>How do the passengers reach their destinations? Here are three major patterns:</p>

			<div class="DivBorder" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 255px;">
				<img src="png/info/od-flow.jpg" style="padding: 10px;"></img> <br />
				<div style="padding: 10px;">
					<b>Image 1</b>: An illustration of non-stop/one-stop/two-stop flight.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="DivBorder" style="float: left">
				<img src="png/info/cvgtosea.jpg" style="padding: 10px;"></img> <br />
				<div style="padding: 10px;">
					<b>Image 2</b>: One-stop flights from CVG to SEA.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div>

			<p>Another example is presented in image2, showing how passengers travel from Cincinnati(CVG)
				to Seattle(SEA) via one-stop flights. We can observe lots of detours.</p>
			<p>In practice, we only focus on zero, one and two stop trips, because they cover about 99%
				itineraries in the database.</p>

			<h2 class="SectionTitle">METHOD</h2>
			<p>The method is to examine the distribution of passengers from an ORIGIN to all the
				DESTINATIONS that they wish to reach. We compute the percentage of passengers who reach their
				destination directly (i.e. non-stop), those that reach via one stop, and so on. For each origin,
				the maps show the share going to a particular destination directly using the blue shaded portion
				of the pie chart. (More blue is better service.) The one stop share is green, and the two stop
				share is red. We do not include the higher stop itineraries as they are comparatively rare as a
				share of total passengers. [Such higher indirect flights can of course account for
				extraordinarily long travel times.]</p>
			<p>As we develop this site, we will also show aggregate statistics for each origin such as
				CIRCUITY and share of total passenger miles that are direct.</p>
