<h2>About T100</h2>

<p>Form 41, Schedules T100, which is an excellent database provided by Bureau of Transportation Statistics, contains comprehensive monthly aggregated records of detail information of the flights start or end within the US territory (including Puerto Rico and Guam) for both passenger and freight. Each record in the database is an aggregated entry for all the flights with the same origin, destination, carrier, aircraft type and month.</p>

<p>One of the defects is that there is a six-month lag before the real data is released.</p>

<p>This system covers the T100 data from January, 1990 to August, 2013. Besides, we only select major airlines which operate schedule flights. Charter flights are excluded from our database.</p>
